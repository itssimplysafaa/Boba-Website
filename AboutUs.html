<h1>About Us</h1>
<body>
  <p>Have you ever wanted to know where the nearest boba place was or where 
    boba merch was sold. Yadhira and Safa decided to bring all these troubles into one 
    blog where you could find anything. We both are big boba conniseurs and felt like there 
    were not many blogs helping first time users find a boba place or what boba is. Going 
    into a boba place can be a bit intimatding since there's so many options. This blog will
    help you get into this aesthetic lifestyle (purrr). </p>
